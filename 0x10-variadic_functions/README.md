This project's purpose is to explore through tasks the following concepts:


    * What are variadic functions
    * How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
    * Why and how to use the const type qualifier

The tasks are as follows:

  0. Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

  1. Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

  2. Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
