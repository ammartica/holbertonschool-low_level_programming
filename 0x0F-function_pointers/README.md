Project: 0x0F. C - Function pointers

Contains a header file with function prototypes and multiple programs that explore the following concepts:


    * What are function pointers and how to use them
    * What does a function pointer exactly hold
    * Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

The tasks are as follows:

  0. Write a function that prints a name.

  1. Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

  2. Write a function that searches for an integer.

  3. Write a program that performs simple operations.
