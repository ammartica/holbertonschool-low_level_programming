Project: 0x08. C - Recursion

This repository has tasks that explore basic recursion concepts such as: what is recursion and how to implement it and in which situations should recursion be implemented or not.

Additionally, this repository contains a main.h header file filled with function prototypes that will be used in the various tasks.
