Project: 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This directory contains files containing big O notations in answer to space
complexity exercises along two search algorithm functions:

  0. Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
  1. Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
